    """
To kick off things we need to define a portfolio to work with.
I like to use the
**iShares Dow Jones Industrial Average UCITS ETF (CIND)**
as it's a simple and well-known portfolio. It only holds 30 stocks
and the price history of the underlying stocks is easy to retrieve.
Remember that the Dow Industrial Average holds an equal amount of shares of each stock!
This means that the stock with the highest price will have the
highest weight in the portfolio.
To replicate the portfolio we can buy either 1 or 10 or 100 shares
of each stock and we're good to go. Or we can just use the amounts that
are in the actual ETF.
